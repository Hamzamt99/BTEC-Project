## What is the IDE :

![IDE](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpuYIfJXXARR1-bRxROAwKZWuv-RZfQkf6iQ&usqp=CAU )

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging[1].

## What is the Operating System :

An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.[2]

## What is the Version-control platform :

A version control system allows users to keep track of the changes in software development projects, and enable them to collaborate on those projects. Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate their tasks through branches.

There can be several branches in a version control system, according to the number of collaborators. The branches maintain individuality as the code changes remain in a specified branch(s).

Developers can combine the code changes when required. Further, they can view the history of changes, go back to the previous version(s) and use/manage code in the desired fashion.[3]
### IDE : 
+ Visual Studio Code:
 Visual Studio Code is a lightweight yet capable source code editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux that runs on your desktop.
 It features built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, as well as a large ecosystem of extensions for additional languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, and Go) (such as .NET and Unity).[4]
 
 + PyCharm :
  PyCharm is a computer programming integrated development environment (IDE) that focuses on the Python programming language. JetBrains, a Czech firm, created it (formerly known as IntelliJ). It includes code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, VCS integration, and Django and Anaconda support for web development and data science, respectively.

  PyCharm is available in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux versions. The Community Edition is distributed under the Apache License, while a Professional Edition with additional features is distributed under a commercial license.[5]
  
  ### Operating System :
  
  + Linux : 
  
  Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware[6]

 #### What is the purpose of the Linux operating system?
Every Linux operating system version controls hardware resources, runs and maintains programs, and provides a user interface in some manner. Because of its large development community and many distributions, there is a Linux version for nearly every task, and Linux has infiltrated many fields of computing.

+ Windows : 
Microsoft Windows serves as the core of most of desktop and laptop computers, with around 90 percent running some version of the operating system. At its most basic, Windows offers a platform for other programs to run. Microsoft has built on this platform over the last three decades, adding in more elaborate user interfaces and features that make the computer it runs on more powerful and easier to use.[7]

### Version-control platform : 

+ GitHub : 

 is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project[8]
 
 + GitLab : 
 
 GitLab is a single application that spans the entire software development lifecycle. If you're not using GitLab, your DevOps lifecycle is likely spread across any number of applications. These silos take overhead to integrate, manage, configure, and maintain, slowing down your team and your deployments. Moving to a single application will speed up your workflow and help you deliver better software, faster. Learn how GitLab can replace any number of your existing applications.[9]
 
 ## The choosen tools and techniques to develop my application :
 
 ### 1 - IDE : 
 
 Why Visual Studio Code :
 
 its easy to :
 +  Edit 
 +  build
 +  debug with ease

### 2- Operating System : 

why Windows :

Windows allows you to surf the web,
check your email, edit digital photographs, listen to music, 
play games, and much more. Many workplaces use Windows because it provides access to productivity tools like calendars,
word processors, and spreadsheets.

### 3 - Version-control platform : 

why GitHub : 

its version control system, which enables seamless collaboration without jeopardizing the original project's integrity. Open-source software may be found in the projects on GitHub.
