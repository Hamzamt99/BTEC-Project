An integrated development environment or for short is a package of software that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers and helps them develop software. 
The development environment usually consists of a text editor for writing the source code of programs, a compiler or interpreter, tools for automating program construction, and usually includes a tracking program to search for errors and problems or what is called a debugger

What exactly is a Version Control System (VCS)? Users may keep track of changes in software development projects and collaborate on them with the help of a version control system.
It allows developers to collaborate on code while also separating their responsibilities into branches.

### IDE : 
+ Visual Studio Code:
 Visual Studio Code is a lightweight yet capable source code editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux that runs on your desktop.
 It features built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, as well as a large ecosystem of extensions for additional languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, and Go) (such as .NET and Unity).
 
 + PyCharm :
  PyCharm is a computer programming integrated development environment (IDE) that focuses on the Python programming language. JetBrains, a Czech firm, created it (formerly known as IntelliJ). It includes code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, VCS integration, and Django and Anaconda support for web development and data science, respectively.Â 

  PyCharm is available in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux versions. The Community Edition is distributed under the Apache License, while a Professional Edition with additional features is distributed under a commercial license.
  
  ### Operating System :
  
  + Linux : 
  
  Linux is a Unix-like operating system for PCs, servers, mainframes, mobile devices, and embedded devices that is open source and community driven. It is one of the most extensively maintained operating systems since it runs on virtually every major computer platform, including x86, ARM, and SPARC.

 #### What is the purpose of the Linux operating system?
Every Linux operating system version controls hardware resources, runs and maintains programs, and provides a user interface in some manner. Because of its large development community and many distributions, there is a Linux version for nearly every task, and Linux has infiltrated many fields of computing.

+ Windows : 
Microsoft Windows (commonly known as Windows or Win) is a graphical operating system that was created and distributed by Microsoft.
It allows you to store data, run applications, play games, watch movies, and access the Internet.

### Version-control platform : 

+ GitHub : 

 GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. Microsoft, the biggest...
 
 + GitLab : 
 
 GitLab is a single application that serves as an open DevOps platform. This distinguishes GitLab and results in a simplified software workflow, freeing your company from the restrictions of a patchwork toolchain.
 Learn how GitLab provides unrivaled insight and productivity across the DevOps lifecycle in a single application.
 
 ## The choosen tools and techniques to develop my application :
 
 ### 1 - IDE : 
 
 Why Visual Studio Code :
 
 its easy to :
 +  Edit 
 +  build
 +  debug with ease

### 2- Operating System : 

why Windows :

Windows allows you to surf the web,
check your email, edit digital photographs, listen to music, 
play games, and much more. Many workplaces use Windows because it provides access to productivity tools like calendars,
word processors, and spreadsheets.

### 3 - Version-control platform : 

why GitHub : 

its version control system, which enables seamless collaboration without jeopardizing the original project's integrity. Open-source software may be found in the projects on GitHub.
